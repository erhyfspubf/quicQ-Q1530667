The quicktime helper makes use of Geoff Stearns' qtobject.js to give you a standards compliant way to embed Quicktime in your page. It also provides friendly detection.

After including the 'qtobject.js' file in your view, using the quicktime_tag helper is simple:

<%= quicktime_tag(:path_to_video_file, :id, :width, :height, options = {} ) %>



Extra parameters that are used by the quicktime embed object can be added using the options hash. For Example:

<%= quicktime_tag(:path_to_video_file, :id, :width, :height, {:loop => true, :autoplay => false} ) %>



use 'rake update_quicktime_script' if the javascript didn't get placed in /public/javascripts.


qtobject.js was masterfully created by Geoff Stearns
